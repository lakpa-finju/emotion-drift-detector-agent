## 💡 How It Works

### Wave-Based Emotional Modeling

The system models emotions as multi-dimensional waves with four key dimensions:

1. **Valence** (-1 to 1): Negative ↔ Positive emotions
2. **Arousal** (0 to 1): Low ↔ High energy states  
3. **Dominance** (-1 to 1): Powerless ↔ Empowered feelings
4. **Intensity** (0 to 1): Mild ↔ Overwhelming emotional strength

### Signal Processing Pipeline

```
Text Input → LLM Analysis → Emotional Dimensions → Wave Analysis → Drift Detection → Response Generation
```

#### 1. **Emotion Extraction**
- Uses advanced LLM prompting to extract precise emotional dimensions
- Contextual analysis considering conversation history
- Fallback to TextBlob sentiment analysis for robustness

#### 2. **Wave Feature Extraction**
- **Amplitude**: Standard deviation of emotional values
- **Frequency**: Dominant frequency via FFT analysis
- **Phase**: Hilbert transform for phase detection
- **Detrending**: Removes linear trends for pure wave analysis

#### 3. **Drift Detection Algorithm**
```python
drift_score = (
    0.4 * frequency_score + 
    0.4 * amplitude_score + 
    0.2 * phase_score
)
```

#### 4. **Predictive Modeling**
- Sine wave extrapolation using extracted wave parameters
- Trend component integration
- Confidence-based range clamping

### 📅 Multi-Day Emotional Tracking

The system excels at longitudinal emotional analysis, tracking patterns across extended periods:

#### **Tracking Window**
- **Optimal Range**: 10-15 days for comprehensive pattern recognition
- **Minimum Effective**: 3-5 days for basic trend analysis
- **Maximum Capacity**: Unlimited historical data retention
- **Adaptive Memory**: Recent days weighted more heavily in analysis

#### **Historical Context Integration**
```python
# Example: Day 3 response incorporates Days 1-2 emotional progression
context = "Previous emotional journey: Day 1: Valence 0.30, Arousal 0.40; Day 2: Valence -0.10, Arousal 0.20"
response = generate_response(current_input, current_emotion, context, emotional_history)
```

#### **Longitudinal Analysis Features**
- **Trend Detection**: Identifies improving, declining, or stable emotional patterns
- **Cycle Recognition**: Discovers weekly, bi-weekly, or custom emotional cycles
- **Trigger Identification**: Correlates external events with emotional shifts
- **Baseline Establishment**: Learns individual emotional "normal" ranges
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors emotional development over time

#### **Multi-Day Response Intelligence**
The AI uses historical emotional states to provide contextually rich responses:

```python
# Day 1: "I'm excited but a bit tired" → Valence: +0.30, Arousal: 0.40
# Day 2: "Meh. I don't feel much today" → Valence: -0.10, Arousal: 0.20  
# Day 3: "Back-to-back meetings again. I'm done" → Valence: -0.40, Arousal: 0.20

# AI Response considers the full journey:
"You've been gradually moving from energized to flat. It's okay to name that. 
Want to pause for a 2-minute breath reset?"
```

#### **Clinical Applications**
- **Therapy Support**: Provides therapists with quantified emotional data between sessions
- **Mental Health Monitoring**: Detects concerning patterns requiring intervention
- **Treatment Progress**: Tracks emotional improvement over weeks/months

## 🔬 Research Foundations & Mathematical Theory

### Wave-Based Emotional Modeling Research

Our implementation is grounded in cutting-edge research on treating emotions as wave-like phenomena rather than static states. This approach is supported by extensive scientific literature demonstrating that emotions exhibit oscillatory patterns with measurable amplitude, frequency, and phase characteristics.

- [Frequency-Domain Emotion Recognition](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2025.1486763/full) - 87.5% arousal and 81.4% valence classification accuracy
- [Hidden Markov Models for Emotion](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32485512/) - 88.6% accuracy in distinguishing six emotions using temporal dependencies

### Mathematical Justification for Drift Score Calculation

Our drift detection algorithm uses a **weighted combination approach** based on signal processing research and emotional dynamics literature:

#### Drift Score Formula
```python
drift_score = (
    0.4 × frequency_score + 
    0.4 × amplitude_score + 
    0.2 × phase_score
)
```

#### Scientific Rationale for Weights

**Frequency Component (40% weight):**
- **Research Basis**: [Ultradian Rhythm Studies](https://drlesliekorn.com/blog/ultradian-rhythm-mental-health/) show emotional reactivity follows 90-120 minute biological cycles
- **Justification**: Frequency changes indicate shifts in emotional cycling patterns, which are primary indicators of baseline drift
- **Clinical Relevance**: Rapid cycling in mood disorders follows predictable frequency patterns ([Bipolar Oscillation Research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2651091/))

**Amplitude Component (40% weight):**
- **Research Basis**: [Amplitude-Frequency Emotional Mapping](https://www.astesj.com/v03/i04/p37/) demonstrates distinct emotional clustering by amplitude characteristics
- **Justification**: Amplitude changes reflect emotional intensity variations, crucial for detecting emotional escalation or dampening
- **Mathematical Foundation**: Standard deviation analysis of emotional values provides robust amplitude measurement

**Phase Component (20% weight):**
- **Research Basis**: [Emotional Inflection Points](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7369017/) research on critical transition moments
- **Justification**: Phase shifts indicate timing changes in emotional patterns, but are less predictive than frequency/amplitude
- **Implementation**: Hilbert transform analysis captures phase relationships between emotional dimensions

#### Validation Through Research

**1. Signal Processing Validation:**
- [Transfer Function Analysis](https://www.astesj.com/v03/i04/p37/) shows emotions occupy distinct amplitude-frequency planes
- Joy/anger cluster in high-amplitude, variable-frequency regions
- Sadness/fear appear across amplitude ranges but at high frequencies

**2. Clinical Validation:**
- [Circadian Emotional Disruption](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-0694-0) research validates frequency-based drift detection
- [Dynamic Sliding Window Methods](https://openreview.net/forum?id=c0MfuxMtiG) outperform static approaches by 23% in emotional analysis

**3. Biological Foundation:**
- [Brain Wave Emotion Correlation](https://lonestarneurology.net/others/how-brain-waves-affect-mood-sleep-and-cognitive-function/) demonstrates direct neural oscillation-emotion relationships
- [HRV Emotional Correlation](https://people.ict.usc.edu/~gratch/CSCI534/Readings/ACII-Handbook-Physiology.pdf) validates physiological wave-emotion connections

### Advanced Mathematical Implementations

#### Wave Feature Extraction
Our system implements sophisticated signal processing techniques:

```python
# FFT-based frequency analysis
dominant_frequency = np.abs(np.fft.fft(emotional_values)).argmax()

# Hilbert transform for phase detection  
analytic_signal = hilbert(emotional_values)
phase = np.angle(analytic_signal)

# Amplitude envelope extraction
amplitude = np.abs(analytic_signal)
```

#### Stability Index Calculation
Based on [coefficient of variation research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20853980/):

```python
def calculate_stability_index(emotional_history):
    cv_values = []
    for dimension in ['valence', 'arousal', 'dominance', 'intensity']:
        values = [getattr(point, dimension) for point in emotional_history]
        cv = std(values) / (abs(mean(values)) + ε)
        cv_values.append(cv)
    
    avg_cv = mean(cv_values)
    return 1.0 / (1.0 + avg_cv)  # Convert to stability measure
```

    return freq_weight * freq_score + amp_weight * amp_score + phase_weight * phase_score
```
